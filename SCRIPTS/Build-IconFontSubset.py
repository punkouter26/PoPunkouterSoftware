Rebuild wwwroot/fonts/material-symbols-subset.woff2 from the full Material Symbols variable
font that ships inside the Radzen.Blazor NuGet package.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Radzen self-hosts MaterialSymbolsOutlined.woff2 — 1,068,920 bytes, roughly 3,600 glyphs — and
modern-ui.css declared it as family "Material Symbols" with `font-display: block`. This app
draws about thirty of those glyphs. So every cold load spent a megabyte on the critical path,
and `block` hides text for up to three seconds while it arrives, which is precisely the
blank-icon behaviour the comment above that @font-face criticises the old Google Fonts <link>
for. Subsetting removes the megabyte; the display strategy then stops mattering.

HOW THE NAMES ARE COLLECTED
---------------------------
Material Symbols renders through LIGATURES: the element's text is the icon's name and the font
substitutes a glyph for the letter run. So a name that is not in ICON_NAMES below does not
degrade to a blank box — it renders as the literal word "refresh" in the middle of a button.
That makes this list load-bearing, and it is why it is deliberately over-inclusive:

  * APP_ICONS — every name this repo names, including the dynamic ones. `grep -rho 'Icon="'`
    misses `Icon="@(_advancedOpen ? "expand_less" : "tune")"` and the whole switch in
    AzureWhatChanged.IconFor, so grep alone is not enough; they were also confirmed by
    walking both routes in a real browser with every disclosure forced open.
  * RADZEN_ICONS — glyphs Radzen's own components emit from inside the compiled assembly,
    where nothing in this repo can see them. Cheap insurance: each extra glyph costs a few
    hundred bytes against a megabyte saved.

ADDING AN ICON
--------------
Add the name to APP_ICONS and re-run:  python SCRIPTS/Build-IconFontSubset.py
Requires: pip install "fonttools[woff]" brotli

The script verifies every requested ligature actually survived into the subset and fails
loudly if one did not, so a typo cannot ship as a word rendered in a button.
