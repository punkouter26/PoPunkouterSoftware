/// <summary>
/// The read contract behind <c>/users</c>: who has signed in to any Po app, from the shared
/// Application Insights component. One endpoint, one consumer — the <c>SignIns</c> page.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>Anonymous, like <c>/api/diag/report</c> and for the same reason: the page is a WASM
/// island with no credential, and this app deliberately has no identity provider. That is
/// precisely why the payload is masked before it leaves the server — see
/// <c>SecretMasking.MaskEmail</c>. The roster contains the addresses of real people,
/// including people who are not the owner, and an unmasked one would publish third-party PII
/// to any visitor.</para>
/// <para>Unprivileged rather than behind <c>.RequireManagementActions()</c>: it mutates
/// nothing and costs one Log Analytics query, which puts it alongside <c>/api/diag/ai</c> and
/// the snooze endpoints. Being anonymous AND a live query is why it is rate-limited — see
/// <c>RateLimits</c>. A management gate would also make it unreachable from the page —
/// the WASM client cannot present the <c>X-Management-Key</c> header — leaving an endpoint
/// whose only caller is its own test, which is the exact shape CLAUDE.md forbids.</para>
