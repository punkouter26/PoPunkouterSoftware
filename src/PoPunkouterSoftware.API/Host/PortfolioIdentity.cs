/// <para>There used to be a second, retired-app set here, holding PoRepoLineTracker after
/// its host stopped resolving. The app was redeployed (<c>app-porepolinetracker</c>, RG
/// <c>PoRepoLineTracker</c>, answering 200), so the set was emptied and removed rather
/// than left as a rule matching nothing. Retiring an app again means deleting its Azure
/// resource — a name-based denylist here silently hides a live app from its own dashboard,
