/// <para>The CSP is strict on scripts on purpose: <c>script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'</c>
/// with no <c>'unsafe-inline'</c>, which is why App.razor's boot and Blazor-hook scripts are
/// external files (js/app-boot.js, js/blazor-hooks.js) rather than inline blocks. Adding an
/// inline &lt;script&gt; anywhere in the host page will now silently stop executing — move it
/// to a file under wwwroot/js instead. <c>'wasm-unsafe-eval'</c> is required by the Blazor
/// WebAssembly runtime; <c>style-src</c> keeps <c>'unsafe-inline'</c> because Radzen and
